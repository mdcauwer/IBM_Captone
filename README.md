# Clustering neighborhoods of downtown Toronto

This is the Capstone project concluding a 9 parts lecture series on data science provided by IBM on Coursera. 

The IBM data science capstone project requires the candidates to explore, segment and cluster neighborhoods in the city of Toronto based on the neighborhoods' amenities. Among the various skills gained by completing the project are:

+ Scraping wikipedia for data using `beautifulsoup` for python.
+ Using `geocoder` for python to retrieve GPS coordinates of neighborhoods.
+ Using the `foursquare` REST API to query for amenities around certain locations.
+ Using the `kmeans` algorithm implemented in `SKLearn`

The project is separated in three parts:

+ Part 1: Scraping and cleaning data from Wikipedia using pandas and beautifulsoup
+ Part 2: Finding GPS coordinates using geocoder
+ Part 3: Exploring and clustering neighborhoods.
